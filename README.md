# The Impact of Debt-to-Equity Ratio on Stock Performance Across Different Sectors 




## Introduction 

This project aims to analyse The Egyptian Market Stock and how the financial health of companies, as measured by the debt-to-equity ratio, affects their stock performance, as indicated by the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Specifically, we seek to determine if this relationship varies across different sectors. 

## Hypothesis 

* Null hypothesis (H0): The debt-to-equity ratio does not significantly impact the RSI within any sector. 

* Alternative hypothesis (Ha): The debt-to-equity ratio significantly impacts the RSI within at least one sector.

## Data

- The "SRC" directory contains the csv file and the python noebook file

- The "DOC" directory contains the rest of required resourses as in the contribution sheet and report etc.


## Data Sources
The data used in this analysis includes financial metrics and stock performance indicators for companies listed on the Egyptian stock market. Key datasets and sources include:

- Debt-to-Equity Ratio (D/E Ratio): Obtained from financial statements and reports of companies.
- Relative Strength Index (RSI): Calculated based on historical stock price data.
- Sector Classification: Companies categorized by sectors such as Banking, Industrial, Consumer Goods, etc.

## Usage
To run this Jupyter notebook, ensure you have the following Python packages installed: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scipy. You can install these packages using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
Copy
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy
```

## Conclusion 

Since Consumer Services, Industrial Services, and Health Services have p-values less than 0.05, we have at least three sectors showing a significant relationship between the debt-to-equity ratio and RSI.  
Therefore, based on our aggregated analysis, we reject the null hypothesis (H0) and conclude that the debt-to-equity ratio significantly impacts the RSI within at least one sector.
