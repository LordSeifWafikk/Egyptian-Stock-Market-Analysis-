##The Impact of Debt-to-Equity Ratio on Stock Performance Across Different Sectors 

#Introduction 

This project aims to analyse The Egyptian Market Stock and how the financial health of companies, as measured by the debt-to-equity ratio, affects their stock performance, as indicated by the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Specifically, we seek to determine if this relationship varies across different sectors. 

#Hypothesis 

-Null hypothesis (H0): The debt-to-equity ratio does not significantly impact the RSI within any sector. 

 

-Alternative hypothesis (Ha): The debt-to-equity ratio significantly impacts the RSI within at least one sector.
